# Inverse design of silicon photonic devices


## GETTING STARTED
First, download the git.

Then download the data : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MrYbl_xirYWJZCTmyr7kOeqM50SCQTUO/view?usp=sharing

Put the data downloaded in "data" under the name "NN_training_combine_new.csv"

### Requirements

You will find all of the dependency you will need installed in order to run this project : *recquirements.txt*

### Objective 

The goal of the project is to predict four design parameters of a nanosilicon waveguide based on the value of the effective index desired. 
In order to run it, all you have to do is.

## MODELS
We are here using inverse design in order to achive this prediction : 

### I- Feedforward model

### II- Inverse Design 
####    a- Tandem Network
####    b- Genetic algorithm
